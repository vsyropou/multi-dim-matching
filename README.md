# multi-dim-matching

A python based tool to match data distributions. The tool is able to match 
a set of correlated data distributions to another set of correlated data 
distributions without the need to bin the relevant data distributions.
More detals in doc/MultiDimMatching.pdf.

The code was quickly developed at the end of my phd thesis. It is more like proof of concept than a project, but still if you need somethign liek this then you will figure it out :-D
