# multi-dim-matching

A python based tool to match data distributions. The tool is able to match 
a set of correlated data distributions to another set of correlated data 
distributions without the need to bin data and thus proffiting from not loosing statistical power.

The code was quickly developed at the end of my phd thesis. It is more like proof of concept than a production ready package, but still something that I was happy to share. The typical use case of such a mathematical tool is from in high energy physics, specifically when one needs to correct the monte carlo generated kinematic variables of particle collisions to reflect more the ones observed in real collsions data.
